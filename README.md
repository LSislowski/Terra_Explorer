To Read through the work I've completed on this repo, first clone the repository and pip install the dependencies that are included (its reccomended that you work in a virtual environment)

Run all cells in the Terra_Eco_Overview notebook and the Terra_sdk notebook.  The overview notebook has interesting information about the distribution of validators and the growth of the network while the Terra_sdk notebook has a few cells that you are able to query information about different wallet addresses.

If you are not sure about a function, first reference the tools.py notebook.
