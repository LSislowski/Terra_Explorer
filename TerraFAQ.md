## What is Terra?

The Terra Blockchain is a smart contract platform developed by Daniel Shin and Do Kwon in 2018.  The launch of the mainnet was on April 24. 2019 and   
it's built using the Cosmos SDK and the Tendermint Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. 

## How is Terra different?

If you already familiar with smart contract ecosystems you'll notice quickly that the largest value add in the 
Terra ecosystem has to do with Stablecoins. The ecosystem allows users to mint nearly 20 different stablecoins that are pegged 
to the value of their respective currency. The largest stablecoin is pegged to the US Dollar which is denoted as UST and the second 
largest stablecoin in use is the Korean Won.  This could be a great value add as the US Government decides the fate of cryptocurrency as it seeks to maintain its dollar dominance in the global economy.

Stablecoins arent the only value-add to the ecosystem.  They recently have enable cross-chain transactions. IBC stands for inter-blockchain communication 
and it's one of the features of the Cosmos Ecosystem.  Terra introduced IBC with its columbus-5 upgrade which will enable transfer packets between other IBC-enabled chains.  A few examples of IBC chains now are Osmosis, Juno, and Secret.  There are some of these tokens on the Terra chain currently. 

## How does Terra generate revenue?

Every on chain transaction incurs a fee or a tax.  *Gas* is paid on all transactions to avoid spamming transactions and to provide 
validators with revenue for their work in keeping the network secure.  A *spread* fee is paid when there is a transaction between Terra and Luna, and a *Tobin* tax is paid on any swap between different stablecoins.  All of these fees are paid to Validators that help secure the network and incentivize better security. 

## Other than Stablecoins what value does Terra offer? 

Terra has an attractive savings protocol named *Anchor* that currently provides returns around 19% APY

## Can others build on Terra?

Yes, Terra is an open source protocol that has pretty good documentation on how to gets started and to learn more.  (Rust is a preferred language if you are looking to create a smart contract or a new Cw20 token)
